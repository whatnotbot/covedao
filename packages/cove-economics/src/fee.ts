/**
 * Cove fee configuration — the ONE canonical place for protocol fees.
 *
 * Backing principal is NEVER a fee; fees are charged in addition (buy) or
 * deducted from the gross payout (redeem), and never reduce the backing below
 * its required state.
 *
 * Each fee has a FLAT component and a PERCENTAGE component, and the flat part
 * is not cosmetic. A pure-percentage fee on a small trade produces a fee output
 * below Bitcoin's relay dust limit, which is non-standard — so the whole
 * transaction is refused. With a 1% fee that put a hard floor of ~29,300 sats
 * on every buy AND on every redemption, locking small holders out of the exit
 * entirely. A flat component above the dust threshold removes that floor.
 *
 * These are DEVELOPMENT defaults. The mainnet fee policy is explicit
 * configuration that must be frozen before any mainnet deployment.
