/**
 * What Cove needs from a Bitcoin wallet.
 *
 * Seven wallets, seven slightly different interfaces. Each adapter reduces its
 * wallet to this, so the rest of the app never learns which one is connected.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: reading UTXOs. Cove asks its own Bitcoin node for
 * those. A wallet's idea of your unspent outputs comes from whatever indexer
 * it happens to use, and disagreeing with the node that will actually validate
 * the transaction is how a build fails for reasons nobody can see.
