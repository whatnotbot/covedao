# Cove

**A CRC-family token protocol on Bitcoin L1 — state-committed Taproot UTXOs,
an open indexer, and a non-custodial marketplace.**

Cove issues tokens whose protocol state is committed into the Taproot output
key of a live UTXO. A token's history is a chain of on-chain state transitions —
`DEPLOY → MINT → TRANSFER → REDEEM` — each one an ordinary, consensus-valid
Bitcoin transaction. Anyone can run the indexer and independently reproduce the
same state root from the same blocks.

Cove sits in the CRC category but runs its own protocol. The authoritative
record is a binary OP_RETURN envelope tagged **`CV`**; an optional second
OP_RETURN carries `crc-20` JSON so CRC explorers can see Cove tokens, but it is
advisory and never read into state. Own ledger, open indexer, reproducible
state.

## What Bitcoin enforces, and what it does not

This is the first thing to understand about Cove, and we state it plainly
rather than burying it.

**Bitcoin enforces:** the Taproot signature on the spend, the UTXO set (no
double-spend, no inflation of BTC), and that the successor output exists with
the exact value and script the transaction commits to.

**Bitcoin does not enforce the token rules.** A Guardian validates each
transition — supply conservation, the issuance curve, payment amounts, the
recovery profile — and signs only if it passes. Bitcoin will not reject an
invalid Cove transition; the indexer ignores it.

So Cove is **client-validated**, like every Bitcoin metaprotocol today. There
are no covenants on Bitcoin mainnet — every proposal (CTV, OP_CAT, APO, CSFS)
is still a draft. What Cove does differently is make the validator reproducible:
the indexer is in this repository, the state root is deterministic, and two
independent operators can check each other. See
[`docs/TRUST_MODEL.md`](docs/TRUST_MODEL.md) for the full model.

## How it works

```
DEPLOY ──► state-committed P2TR vault (NUMS internal key, MAST)
             │
   MINT ─────┤  Guardian validates the real PSBT, runs the Simplicity
             │  predicate, then signs the execution leaf
             ▼
           successor vault  (new state → new output key → new address)
             │
TRANSFER ────┤  token UTXOs move between owners
REDEEM ──────┘  burn tokens, release the backing BTC
```

Each vault's output key is `Q = P + H_TapTweak(P ‖ stateCommitment)·G`, so the
address itself is a commitment to the protocol state. The vault carries three
tapleaves: MINT and REDEEM execution paths bound to a Simplicity program
commitment (CMR), and a **threshold recovery leaf** (2-of-3, or 1-of-1) behind
a relative timelock.

The issuance curve is a frozen 210-stair integer staircase. All arithmetic is
`bigint`; there is no floating point anywhere in the consensus path.

## Getting started

Requires Node 22, pnpm 10, Docker, and Rust (for the Simplicity binary).

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env          # local regtest; sets COVE_NETWORK=regtest
(cd packages/cove-simplicity/rust && cargo build --release)

pnpm dev:infra                # Postgres + bitcoind regtest in Docker, DB schema pushed
pnpm dev                      # web (http://localhost:3000) + V3 worker

pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test
```

`pnpm dev:infra` mines 101 blocks and funds the dev wallet identities (alice,
bob, carol) on a fresh chain, then a miner container mines a block every 10 s
(`MINE_INTERVAL`). On regtest the web app runs the Guardian policy in-process
with the public test keys, so the standalone Guardian (`pnpm dev:guardian`) is
not needed for manual testing. Stop with `pnpm dev:infra:down`; wipe the chain
and database with `pnpm dev:infra:reset`.

Browser wallets do not support regtest, so locally **Connect** lists the
built-in test wallets (alice, bob, carol) with their BTC. They sign on the
server with the public fixture keys; disconnect and connect again to switch.

`COVE_NETWORK` is required by every service; nothing defaults to regtest.
Everything that is not a secret or a per-deploy endpoint is committed:
per-network settings in `packages/config/src/cove-networks.ts`, the mainnet
profile in `packages/cove-mainnet/src/committed-profile.ts`. See
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#configuration).

Signet with real browser wallets: `scripts/signet-up.sh`.

Build the Simplicity predicate and verify the frozen CMRs:

```bash
cd packages/cove-simplicity/rust && cargo build --release
```

## Proofs

Every claim in this repository has an executable proof against real Bitcoin
Core — not a mock. These run in CI on every push to `main` and every pull
request.

```bash
pnpm cove:regtest-proof            # state-committed vault spend
pnpm cove:csv-proof                # NUMS/MAST, 144-block CSV recovery leaf
pnpm cove:v3-regtest-lifecycle     # DEPLOY → MINT → TRANSFER → REDEEM
pnpm cove:regtest-reorg            # reorg recovery, root == clean replay
pnpm cove:signet-proof             # signet lifecycle, real broadcast
```

| Workflow | Proves |
| --- | --- |
| `ci` | typecheck, lint, test, build |
| `cove-v3-lifecycle` | full lifecycle against real `bitcoind` |
| `cove-v3-indexer` | persistence, reorg recovery, backup/restore round-trip |
| `cove-v3-market` | P2P listing, fill, settlement |
| `cove-v3-product` | browser end-to-end against a real node |
| `cove-simplicity` | Simplicity ↔ TypeScript differential, frozen CMRs |
| `cove-vault-csv` | vault script paths |
| `cove-v3-mainnet-readiness` | readiness gate against a real Guardian |

## Mainnet status

**Mainnet is not activated.** The committed profile
(`packages/cove-mainnet/src/committed-profile.ts`) still has placeholders for
every owner decision — activation height, Guardian key, recovery keys (2-of-3
or 1-of-1), fee destination and bps, canary allowlists and caps — so mainnet
refuses to start until they are filled in. The profile also refuses any key
or script controlled by the repo's public test keys.

Once the profile validates, mainnet runs as three services (web, worker,
Guardian) with only these env vars:

| Service | Env (see `apps/*/.env.example`) |
| --- | --- |
| web | `COVE_NETWORK`, `COVE_DATABASE_URL`, `COVE_BITCOIN_RPC_URL`, `COVE_GUARDIAN_ENDPOINT`, `COVE_GUARDIAN_AUTH_TOKEN`, `COVE_FEE_ADDRESS` |
| worker | `COVE_NETWORK`, `COVE_DATABASE_URL`, `COVE_BITCOIN_RPC_URL`, `COVE_GUARDIAN_ENDPOINT`, `COVE_GUARDIAN_AUTH_TOKEN`, `COVE_FEE_ADDRESS` |
| guardian | `COVE_NETWORK`, `COVE_DATABASE_URL`, `COVE_BITCOIN_RPC_URL`, `GUARDIAN_AUTH_TOKEN`, `GUARDIAN_KEY_HEX`, `COVE_FEE_ADDRESS` |

The Guardian refuses to start unless `GUARDIAN_KEY_HEX` matches the profile's
`guardianXOnly`. On Railway the web may reach it over private networking
(`http://<guardian>.railway.internal:4391`); anywhere else it must be https.
The canary allowlists and caps in the profile are enforced on every mutation.

`COVE_FEE_ADDRESS` is the one address every protocol fee is paid to. It fills
the profile's `feeScript` before the profile is hashed, so set it once (a
shared variable) for all three services: web and worker compare their profile
hash with the Guardian's at startup and stop on a mismatch.

Check readiness at any time:

```bash
pnpm cove:v3-mainnet-readiness --static    # profile completeness
pnpm cove:v3-mainnet-readiness --runtime   # live Core, Guardian, indexer probes
```

Remaining work before a controlled canary is tracked in
[`docs/MAINNET_V3_CHECKLIST.md`](docs/MAINNET_V3_CHECKLIST.md); the operator
procedure is [`docs/CANARY_DAY_ONE.md`](docs/CANARY_DAY_ONE.md).

## Security

Cove has been through three independent adversarial audits covering the
Guardian signing path, the activation gates, and the marketplace. Findings and
the fixes that closed them are in the git history.

**The Guardian key is the trust boundary.** Bitcoin enforces that funds move to
*a* state-committed successor; the Guardian decides *which*. A compromised
Guardian cannot inflate supply or steal backing satoshis — the policy engine
recomputes every amount from canonical state and validates the real
transaction — but it is the component to protect.
[`docs/GUARDIAN_CUSTODY.md`](docs/GUARDIAN_CUSTODY.md) covers backend options.

Key material is never held by the web app or worker. The Guardian holds its
key in `GUARDIAN_KEY_HEX` on its own service. The ceremony tool writes each
private key to a separate `0600` file and prints only x-only public keys:

```bash
pnpm cove:ceremony-keys --out /Volumes/<removable>/ceremony
```

> The WIF and `0x42`-style keys in the test suite are **publicly known burner
> keys**. Never fund them.

public issue.
